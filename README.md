Always-listening voice commands for reddit!

## Things you must have

* Chrome (latest version is best)
* a reddit account (the extension will probably break if you are not logged in)
* Reddit enhancement suite
* HTTPS everywhere with HTTPS reddit activated (go to reddit, click the HTTPS everywhere icon and enable pay.reddit.com)

If you don't surf reddit with HTTPS, you will be asked everytime if the mic may be accessed.

## Commands available

You can start a command using 'reddit', 'ok reddit' or just start talking without a prefix.

* 'select post 5'
* 'upvote'
* 'downvote'
* 'next post' / 'previous post'
* 'how many unread messages do I have?' (this speaks the message count back to you)
* 'read messages'
* 'go to subreddit technology'
* 'open link'
